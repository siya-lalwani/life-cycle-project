# Life Cycle Project

## 🧪 Project Overview  
This project analyses a life‑cycle dataset to uncover insights about the different stages and characteristics of the cycle under study. It uses Python (in a Jupyter Notebook) to handle data processing, visualization, and interpretation of results.

## 🔍 Objectives  
- Load and clean the dataset (`Final_data.csv`).  
- Explore the data: understand structure, missing values, distributions.  
- Visualize key relationships and patterns (e.g., feature correlations, stage transitions).  
- Interpret the findings: what do the visuals tell us?  
- Summarize conclusions and possible next‑steps or improvements.

## 📁 Files & Structure  
- `Final_data.csv` – the processed dataset used for analysis.  
- `life_cycle.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing full workflow: import, cleaning, EDA, visualizations, interpretations.

## 🧮 Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc.

## 🧰 Workflow  
1. Load the dataset and inspect its shape, columns, and summary statistics.  
2. Handle missing values or inconsistencies (if any).  
3. Visualize features: histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmap, scatter plots.  
4. Interpret each visualization: what it reveals about the lifecycle process.  
5. Draw conclusions: key findings, limitations, and potential future enhancements.

## 🔍 Key Findings (Summary)  
- For example: *“The correlation heatmap highlights a strong positive relationship between features A and B, suggesting…”*  
- For example: *“The scatter plot of X vs Y shows a cluster in the early stage, indicating…”*  
- (You’ll want to replace these with your actual insights.)

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/siya-lalwani/life-cycle-project.git  
   ```  
2. Navigate into project folder and open the notebook:  
   ```bash  
   cd life-cycle-project  
   jupyter notebook life_cycle.ipynb  
   ```  
3. Ensure required libraries are installed (e.g., via `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`).  
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis, visuals and interpretations.

## ✅ Next Steps & Improvements  
- Automate dataset ingestion and cleaning for new or updated data.  
- Add more advanced modeling (e.g., classification or regression on lifecycle outcomes).  
- Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., using Streamlit or Dash) for exploring visuals.  
- Document code functions more thoroughly and modularize sections for reuse.
